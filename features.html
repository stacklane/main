                        All Stacklane functionality is represented by well-known and easy to maintain files.
                        There are no complex configurations or new interfaces to learn.
                        Keep you and your team in sync with standard file formats,
                        and GIT connections to

                        Stacklane uses a highly tuned server-side JavaScript engine,
                        optimized for type-safe validation, security, and scale.
                        It's a subset of the JavaScript you already know,
                        with perfect abstractions for common web app functionality.

                        Use the logic-less Mustache templating language to define HTML views.
                        Its simple syntax keeps things moving, and any collaborators feeling right at home.

                    Carefully designed and integrated component abstractions ensure that code
                    always takes advantage of scale, security, and maintainability.

                    With Stacklane data models become as easy to use as a CSS file.
                    Drop in a file with your model definition, and it immediately becomes available to code.
                    Production environments use geographic replication, sharding, and caching to ensure
                    fast and available data.

                    Let users keep the passwords they already have, from trusted third parties they already know.
                    Define security roles and access rules to ensure users only access the areas they should.

                    One of the web's greatest accomplishments is its rich cross-linking and resource sharing.
                    Stacklane makes connections to third party APIs always type-safe, secure,
                    and reusable between projects.

                    Credentials related to third party integrations use our secure key vault.
                    This ensures that third party usernames, passwords, credentials,
                    and tokens are never stored in source code, since they are unusable from within the source code itself.

                    architecture and infrastructure, ensuring confidence for every deployment.

                    An 80+ location content delivery network, and redundant endpoint hosts,
